# local_practices_adaptation_modelling_workflow
Scripts used to develop the modelling workflow used in the article "Adaptation potential of local water management practices to glacier loss". The scripts include post-processing of JULES land-surface model outputs, combining with glacier evolution simulations, routing model, deep sub-surface separation and routing, and three interventions models.
